# Development Tools

This repository contains scripts used to deploy or upgrade an Elhub Windows developer PC.

These scripts are inspired by the (Microsoft Windows Dev Box setup scripts)[https://github.com/microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts] and 
leverage two popular open source projects:

* Boxstarter (boxstarter.org)[http://boxstarter.org]
* Chocolatey (chocolatey.org)[http://chocolatey.org]
