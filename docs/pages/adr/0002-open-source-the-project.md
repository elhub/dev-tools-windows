# 2. open-source-the-project

Date: 2020-01-26

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Elhub has as a goal of the company to provide benefits to society;
open-sourcing software is just one of many small ways that the development
department can contribute to that goal. We consider that the following
project contains no secrets, nor sensitive information about our
infrastructure. And while the project is not likely to be directly usable
by others, it is possible that parts of the setup created here can be reused
or serve as an inspiration.

## Decision

The dev-tools-windows project shall be released under an open-source
license.

## Consequences

* The project repository shall be moved into github.com/elhub
* Future work on the project must take extra care not to allow secrets or
sensitive information to be added to the project.
